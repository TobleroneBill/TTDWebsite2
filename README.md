 Test Driven Dev Website

This was for a C# Apprenticeship and mirrors an old project I made for the same purpose.
this video is about me trying to explain my thought process but I am so pressed for time that I just basically blazed through it so it might just make you more confused instead of clarifying:

Guide:
<ul>
<li>Spreadsheets has 1 spreadsheet, with 2 tabs - a user stories one, and a Test cycle one.</li>
<li>Website - has the HTML/CSS/JS code </li>
<li>MVC rar file - contains all the project files for the MVC files</li>
<li>Other Stuff - contains MVC source code. Only the important solutions, so it shouldnt be usable unless you copy it into a new visual studio  2022 project</li>
</ul>
